# Whisperyn Site Starter

Vue 3 + Vite starter for the Whisperyn home page and creator-page skeletons.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed local URL in your browser.

### Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start dev server
- `npm run build` – production build
- `npm run preview` – preview built files
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint on `src`

### Routes

- `/` – Home (forest + trispire hero)
- `/krov`, `/okami`, `/slaynagrey`, `/abelix`, `/kengaming`, `/bear1227` – creator shells

Each creator view is a separate `.vue` file so you can evolve them into fully unique layouts.
